# COM Hook DLL Injection - Troubleshooting Steps

## Root Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect File Paths**: The diagnostic scripts were looking for files in subdirectories, but Injector.x86.exe is in the root directory
2. **DLL Injection Failure**: The injection is failing with "LoadLibraryA returned 0" error

## Step 1: Check for Missing Dependencies
The most likely reason for LoadLibraryA failing is missing dependencies. Install:

- **Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022 (x86)**:
  - Download from: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe
  - Install and restart your computer

## Step 2: Create Windows Defender Exclusions
1. Open Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Manage settings
2. Scroll down to "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions"
3. Add these exclusions:
   - `C:\Users\manfr\Downloads\hook\Injector.x86.exe` (File)
   - `C:\Users\manfr\Downloads\hook\build\Interceptor.x86.dll` (File) 
   - `C:\temp` (Folder)

## Step 3: Test Injection with Defender Disabled (Admin required)
1. Right-click Command Prompt or PowerShell and select "Run as administrator"
2. Navigate to your hook directory:
   ```
   cd /d C:\Users\manfr\Downloads\hook
   ```
3. Run the defender test script:
   ```
   .\defender_test_inject.bat
   ```
4. Observe if the injection succeeds with Defender temporarily disabled

## Step 4: Create a Simplified DLL (If the above steps don't work)
If you have Visual Studio or the Build Tools installed:

1. Create a minimal DLL without MinHook or other complex code
2. Compile it with the same settings as your original DLL
3. Test if this simplified DLL can be injected

## Step 5: Check for Architecture Mismatches
Ensure both the Java process and your DLL are 32-bit:
- Confirm that you're targeting a 32-bit Java process
- Check if Interceptor.x86.dll was compiled for 32-bit

## Additional Checks
1. **Process Protection**: Some processes are protected by the OS. Check that your Java process isn't protected.
2. **File Integrity**: Ensure Injector.x86.exe hasn't been quarantined or modified by antivirus.
3. **DLL Location**: Try copying Interceptor.x86.dll to the same folder as the Java executable.
4. **Check Error Logs**: Check Windows Event Logs for security-related events blocking the injection.

## If All Else Fails: Alternative Approach
Consider using the COM port redirection approach instead, which doesn't require DLL injection:
- Create a virtual COM port pair
- Redirect the GlobalTIS application to use one port
- Monitor traffic on the other port
