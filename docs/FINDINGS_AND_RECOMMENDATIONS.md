# COM Port Traffic Monitoring: Findings and Recommendations

## Current Status

Based on our extensive testing, we have identified the following key points:

1. **DLL Injection Behavior**:
   - The DLL is successfully injected but immediately detaches
   - This is confirmed by the log file showing:
     ```
     --- Hook DLL Attached ---
     MinHook Initialized.
     Hooks Created.
     Hooks Enabled.
     --- Hook DLL Detaching ---
     Hooks Disabled.
     MinHook Uninitialized.
     ```
   - Despite the Injector reporting "DLL injection failed. LoadLibraryA returned 0", the DLL is initially loaded

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The DLL is loading but immediately exiting in the DLL_PROCESS_DETACH section
   - This suggests an initialization issue or permission problem accessing required resources
   - The most likely cause is that the DLL is failing to properly hook the COM port APIs

## Recommendations

### Immediate Steps

1. **Modify the DLL code in `src/hook.cpp`**:
   - Add more detailed error logging in the DllMain function
   - Add a 5-second sleep before detaching to help debug the issue
   - Log the specific result codes from MH_Initialize and MH_CreateHookApi

2. **Test with COM Port Simulation**:
   - We noticed you have com0com installed
   - Create a simple Java test application that performs basic COM port operations
   - This will give us a controlled environment to test the hooking

3. **Try Process Monitor**:
   - Use Sysinternals Process Monitor to trace file and registry operations
   - Filter for operations by the javaw.exe process
   - Look for any failed operations related to COM ports

### Alternative Approaches

1. **Hardware COM Port Analyzer**:
   - Consider using a physical COM port analyzer that sits between devices
   - This eliminates the need for DLL injection entirely

2. **Serial Port Redirection**:
   - Set up a virtual COM port pair with com0com
   - Redirect the Java application to use one port of the pair
   - Monitor the other port with a separate application

3. **Java-based Instrumentation**:
   - Use the Java Instrumentation API to hook into the Java process
   - Add bytecode instrumentation to the Java classes that handle serial communication
   - This approach requires JAR modifications but avoids OS-level DLL injection

## Next Steps

1. **Focus on Continuous Monitoring**:
   - The `continuous_monitor.ps1` script will continually re-inject the DLL
   - This may capture brief windows of COM traffic before detachment

2. **Enhance the Filter Tool**:
   - The `filter_com_traffic.ps1` tool can be used to analyze any captured data
   - Look for partial snippets of the protocol

3. **Rebuild for Stability**:
   - Consider rebuilding the DLL with debug symbols and additional error handling
   - Focus on adding code to prevent premature detachment

## Conclusion

While the current approach is facing stability issues with the DLL remaining loaded, we have created a toolkit that provides multiple approaches to monitoring COM port traffic. The recommended path forward is to either:

1. Debug and fix the DLL detachment issue
2. Use one of the alternative approaches that don't rely on DLL injection

The most reliable approach currently is to use the `continuous_monitor.ps1` script, which will persistently attempt to maintain the hook despite detachment issues.
